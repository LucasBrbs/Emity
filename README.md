# The ideia 
 
 O nosso projeto incita que o usuario individual cuide da sua residencia de forma sustentavel (NET0), e além disso tambem construa e mostre o porque disso ser eficiente
 
# Registration
    The user registers the app and is faced with several ways to be ecologically correct and Tips on how to do this, each of the user's actions will lead him to earn points in 2 different categories and they are a waste of light and water.
 
# What should i do when downloading the app
    The app will have ready-made ideas on how to be ecologically correct, going from installing solar panels to using water correctly, these types of actions accumulate points that generate bonuses
    Points are counted from the user's submit, who was to take photos and document his change in an intuitive and fast way using the application and a few clicks he can easily collect the points
    Points and bonuses will be distributed with tier, that is, the higher your tier, the greater your bonus to a maximum of 5 tiers.
    In addition to individual bonuses, points will be given to neighborhoods and communities that manage to transform their environment together.
    The app only complements people's actions not forcing them to be ecological but with few steps and in an economical way it is possible to change the world and that's what emity talks about.
# Reward
    The bonuses can be the most varied but as we want to make something accessible and economical, the main line of bonuses would be with insensation of some fees and a decrease in the electricity bill according to the user's tier.
    If the app was linked to a store, it would be possible to earn coupons from that store so that the user can earn discounts.
    In addition, if he is an activist, it is also possible to have the bonus of a tree planted in certain regions to be able to see that his change not only affects the app but also his city, thus creating a high-effort high-reward system.
## Name
 the name emity comes from the word emityca which in the tupi-guarani language means plantation or garden, showing the community as a garden to be taken care of.
 
## Logo
The logo is based on two leaves and a universal union symbol.
